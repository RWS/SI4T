This project is under construction, with first release projected for 6 June 2013.\r\n\r\n# Project Goal\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to provide a generic framework for integration of the SDL Tridion CMS with front-end search engines for your web applications. As such it is concerned with:\r\n\r\n* Configuring what content in the CMS gets indexed\r\n* Generating indexing data/indexing instructions\r\n* Providing a framework for deploying data into a search index/notifying a search engine of (un/re)publishing actions\r\n\r\nThe project is not concerned with providing search engine specific integration code, but rather the hooks in which search engine specific modules can be integrated. The exception to this is the [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) search engine. Solr integration modules are provided as an example to get a simple search engine integration up and running, and to be used as a basis for other search engine-specific modules, which we encourage to be developed under open source license in separate projects.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
